## DSet: A Dominion Card Set Generator

This app simulates a Dominion randomizer deck to produce a set of 10 cards to play a game of Dominion. It provides additional features defining what cards to include/exclude, search functionality, and the ability to set global rules for what expansions should be allowed and/or to enforce a spread of card costs.
